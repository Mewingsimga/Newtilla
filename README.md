Manual Installation

If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST! Simply go to the latest BepinEx release and extract BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, go to the latest release of this mod and extract it directly into your game's folder. Make sure it's extracted directly into your game's folder and not into a subfolder!

For Developers
Important: Utilla 1.6.0 Update
With the release of Utilla 1.6.0, mods are required to only function in modded gamemodes, instead of in any private lobby. Utilla provides easy to use attributes to make this transition as painless as possible. See this commit for an example of updating your mod to work with the new system.
